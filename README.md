Anomaly Detection and Event Prediction
This repository contains code and resources for detecting anomalies and predicting events using advanced machine learning techniques. The project aims to identify unusual patterns in data that may indicate significant events or irregularities.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Tools for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
Anomaly Detection Algorithms: Implementation of various algorithms such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and Autoencoders.
Event Prediction Models: Predictive models using time series forecasting, recurrent neural networks (RNN), and more.
Visualization: Interactive dashboards and visualizations to explore and interpret results.
Real-time Monitoring: Framework for real-time data monitoring and alerting on detected anomalies.
